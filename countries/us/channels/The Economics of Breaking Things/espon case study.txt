Now this one is a comedic situation: Epson programmed certain inkjet printers to stop working after a set amount of use, even if the hardware on the printer was perfectly fine. Back in 2022, Epson users found that their printers would suddenly output a message telling the users that their “printer reached the end of their service life” and then not let them print anymore. Well there has got to be something that is stopping the printer from printing, right? Right???? The culprit, Epson claimed, was a pad that exists inside the printer that collects excessive ink which acts as a safeguard to prevent ink from overflowing and damaging the printer. Makes sense, other than the fact that they also made it very difficult to service and actually downright non-serviceable for some models. Great engineering for a multi-billion dollar company.
